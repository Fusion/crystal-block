Highlight matching crystal block when cursor is on the following keywords:

`end`, `elsif`, `else`, `when` `rescue` and `ensure`.

This is nothing more than a search/replace of [ruby-block](https://github.com/hmatsuda/ruby-block) where I replace 'ruby' with 'crystal'

Of course, it works!

So, all thanks go to [Haruhiko Kobayashi](https://github.com/hmatsuda)
